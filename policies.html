              <p>All great meals take time, but this one takes it to the next level! More than 650 hours
                of fermenting, brining, aging, and curing goes into each and every one of our legendary
                Reuben sandwiches.
              </p>
              <p>Every element of this extraordinary sandwich is handcrafted in our kitchens, from the rye
                bread baked from our secret recipe to the cave-aged Swiss cheese, right down to the
                pickle. The only thing we didn't make on the premises is the toothpick ( but we're
                looking into how to do that).
